# ðŸ¤– AI & Data Mining Labs

Welcome to my repository for **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data Mining** lab work!  
This repo contains my practical solutions, mini-projects, and notes from college coursework.

I believe the best way to learn is by practicingâ€”and this repo reflects that mindset.
